rated.","startTime":"04:28","endTime":"04:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Whether you're nice to people, the way you tip a waiter, the way you speak to your employees at

this and really build a bit of a mini world around it, create a metagame of sorts that allowed people to get a social score and continue ranking up through the system.","startTime":"04:44","endTime":"04:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so what you'll see over the next few months is really kind of continuing to build on this

score.","startTime":"05:45","endTime":"05:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And as part of season two, you also have a

up.","startTime":"06:03","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The idea is that there'll be a AI agent that is your consultant, basically helping you reach your five star destiny.","startTime":"06:06","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you can earn tokens for participating in different challenges and experiences over

Universe.","startTime":"06:24","endTime":"06:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But for the next phase, this is going to be the bulk of what everyone is going to be engaging with.","startTime":"06:28","endTime":"06:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's not like the social scores will disappear, but they'll still play a role in the sort of Black Mirror meta game, as we call it.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the idea is we'll be launching the Black Mirror Agent.","startTime":"06:41","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It will be the first ever Black Mirror Agent and official token.","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the way it works is everyone can connect their socials to find their social score.","startTime":"06:48","endTime":"06:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can engage in daily quests and social challenges to increase your performance.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you can even train the AI.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"06:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can take part in different experiences, different UGC quests to basically grow the way that AI thinks about the world that it exists within.","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the more you contribute to the AI's personality, the more rewards you earn.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We also have a network of different applications that will be launching different games, different mini products that have the agent central to the way that you engage with the Black Mirror Universe.","startTime":"07:13","endTime":"07:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is going to be a cross platform experience.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It will take place across Twitter, Telegram, there'll be games that we partner with.","startTime":"07:28","endTime":"07:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to continuously grow, but to

with.","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of those is the reputation

score.","startTime":"07:51","endTime":"07:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The agent will look at your on chain activity, it will look at your social activity and it will give you challenges to improve your stats.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"08:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The more you improve your stats, the more rewards you earn.","startTime":"08:04","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"From there, the agent will also engage in fun little banter as we call it.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You'll chat to you, it will create content and it will sometimes give you raw feedback directly on socials.","startTime":"08:12","endTime":"08:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It will tell you like, hey, we don't like this or you could do better

reputation slashing mechanics are some.","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The agent can slash your reputation score if it looks like you are being an NPC or you're a bot, it will literally cut your social score.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you need to participate, you need to add value to the narrative in order to be a participant, in order to become a main character and to reach your five star

will be launching the agent with us.","startTime":"20:15","endTime":"20:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so what to expect is over the next few weeks we will start the

1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So over the next few weeks you'll be able to engage with the UGC challenges, you'll be able to create your own content with the AI and then the agent will launch in February where the official token will also go live.","startTime":"20:36","endTime":"20:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you are a holder of smile passes, if you've minted a character from the latest drop, if you hold a Core Founders pass, you will basically be eligible for the token airdrop.","startTime":"20:48","endTime":"21:02","speaker_name":"speaker

in.","startTime":"21:30","endTime":"21:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're always listening and the agent is always listening as well.","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:39","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's see, what can you leak for the future of Black

Black Mirror stories, as you can see, like we're taking a heavy emphasis on narrative and world building.","startTime":"21:45","endTime":"21:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, we really want the community to help shape the story and to help build out the law of Black Mirror as it goes on chain.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So between the AI tools, between the skits and the mini episodes, tons of stuff to look forward to on that front.","startTime":"22:03","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Some of the other Key things that we'll be launching.","startTime":"22:11","endTime":"22:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of course, the token is very central to this.","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The first ever Black Mirror Token is a huge deal, I think, for the ecosystem.","startTime":"22:15","endTime":"22:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We've seen other IP tokens like Simon's Cat, for example, perform extremely well.","startTime":"22:21","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They're two $300 million value tokens.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we really believe the Black Mirror Token can achieve a similar fate over time.","startTime":"22:31","endTime":"22:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we'll really be building out the token economy of this, making sure that the token has value and that the community can help participate in the growth of that ecosystem.","startTime":"22:36","endTime":"22:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There'll be many other experiences launching, there'll be new episodes.","startTime":"22:46","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Some of the other episodes that we have lined up include the entire history of you, as well as a few others that are central.","startTime":"22:51","endTime":"22:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can expect the token launch, more AI experiences where the community can participate, and a ton of other application experiences for the community to engage with.","startTime":"22:58","endTime":"23:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let me see.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Next

enabled.","startTime":"23:29","endTime":"23:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It was still very much a private collection.","startTime":"23:31","endTime":"23:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we're migrating it over to a new contract.","startTime":"23:33","endTime":"23:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The old contract and SMART and collection will be delisted with opensea.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it will be completely blanked out and anyone who has minted will receive the same exact NFT or number of NFTs that they minted in the original mint.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So nothing to do on your side there?","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have all the data on our end and that will be executed within the next few days.","startTime":"23:55","endTime":"23:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can imagine it by Wednesday I believe as the team executes is what the team has set.","startTime":"24:00","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So nothing to do on your side there.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:06","speaker_name":"speaker

1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we have all of that metadata on our end and all will be sorted.","startTime":"24:14","endTime":"24:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Any chance we'll get another chance to add a picture of PFP during this remit?","startTime":"24:21","endTime":"24:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think the lack of instruction was a missed opportunity in the first mint and seeing a subsequent bunch of no pfp nfts.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, 100%.","startTime":"24:34","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we'll be again, all of those features will be reactivated.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Everyone will be able to re upload their picture as

experiences not just with Broadside, but many others as well.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"25:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yes, 100%, some stuff to look forward to there.","startTime":"25:00","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can see someone asking about nodes that is related to Core protocol, so I won't cover that in this call, but we can discuss that and probably on the next Core Protocol ama.","startTime":"25:04","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If any of you are not in the Core Protocol Discord, I would suggest going into that because that is really the hub for all of the things that we're doing.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not just Black Mirror, but every other IP and property that we are developing, the whole reward system, the token airdrops, most of those will be communicated in the core Protocol Discord.","startTime":"25:23","endTime":"25:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you like the vision of what Black Mirror is doing, you really want to be a

things.","startTime":"31:49","endTime":"31:51","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Over time, we'll also be focusing on helping people turn their characters into their own AI agents.","startTime":"31:51","endTime":"31:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So everyone who has a character can make that an AI agent in the Black Mirror Universe.","startTime":"31:59","endTime":"32:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So imagine a few months from now where you have a couple hundred, a couple thousand characters,

Mirror Universe, building out the IP over time.","startTime":"32:18","endTime":"32:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one of the things that we really want to lean into is basically turning your character into its own fully autonomous AI agent.","startTime":"32:33","endTime":"32:42","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In the Black Mirror Universe, there'll always be the main AI Agent, that's sort of the main character.","startTime":"32:42","endTime":"32:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then your character will

rewards.","startTime":"32:51","endTime":"32:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So token airdrops access to experiences and things of that

discussion.","startTime":"33:03","endTime":"33:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can see there's a few core community members in here.","startTime":"33:06","endTime":"33:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's, you know, I think we've probably touched on it in previous

work.","startTime":"33:12","endTime":"33:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We want to make sure we get it right.","startTime":"33:17","endTime":"33:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We've been doing a lot of work to remove any bots and things of that

you know, really rewarded for the time that they've spent building out this ecosystem and more.","startTime":"33:26","endTime":"33:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Mark has said core founders past rarity also relate to the airdrop.","startTime":"33:37","endTime":"33:41","speaker_name":"speaker

100%.","startTime":"33:42","endTime":"33:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's a very good question.","startTime":"33:43","endTime":"33:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And exactly the way that we're thinking about it, you know, if you have a five star character, then you're more likely to receive a higher airdrop than someone who has a one star character.","startTime":"33:45","endTime":"33:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, you know, all those things are going to be very central to the design off the airdrop as well.","startTime":"33:57","endTime":"34:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"34:06","endTime":"34:06","speaker_name":"speaker

token.","startTime":"34:12","endTime":"34:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you're part of this community, you're not just getting one token, you're getting two.","startTime":"34:25","endTime":"34:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"34:29","endTime":"34:30","speaker_name":"speaker
